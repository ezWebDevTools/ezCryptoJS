Note: There is no server-side functionality baked in so all your data remains local to you. However, there are numerous browers extensions
that do rely on non-local resources. In theory they are able to monitor this page and "steal" your valuable data.

Disclaimer: There were no security and/or crypto expects involved in the making of this remix.
