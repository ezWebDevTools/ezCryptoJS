Note: There is no server-side functionality baked in so all your data remains local to you. However, there are numerous browers extensions
that do rely on non-local resources. In theory they are able to monitor this page and "steal" your valuable data.

####Disclaimer: There were zero security and/or crypto experts involved in the making of this remix.
